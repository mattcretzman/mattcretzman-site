    <p class="post-subtitle">The origin story of Matt Cretzman — from nonprofit leadership and loss to building 9 companies with AI agent systems. The full path from there to here.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="post-body">
  <div class="container-narrow">
    <p>I've been writing this week about the companies I'm building and the technical systems behind them. But the "how" doesn't make sense without the "how I got here." This is that story.</p>

<p>It's not a highlight reel. There are parts I'd rather skip, and parts that still sting when I write them down. But they're all connected, and I think the connections matter more than the individual moments.</p>

<div class="post-divider"></div>

<h2 class="post-h2">The Nonprofit Years</h2>

<p>I'm originally from Canada. I spent my twenties doing what I believed I was made to do — building things for other people.</p>

<p>I founded an international nonprofit called Rooftop Missions and spent six years leading it. I became a global associate trainer with John Maxwell's EQUIP International, overseeing partnership and training programs in Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and India. I wasn't building software. I was building organizations, training programs, and teams across countries where the work mattered in ways you could see immediately.</p>

<p>The most meaningful thing I built during that season was a children's home in India. I named it the Azlynn Noelle Children's Home.</p>

<p>I named it after my daughter.</p>

<div class="post-divider"></div>

<h2 class="post-h2">February 2012</h2>

<p>I was driving to a conference in Ohio. The road was slick with black ice. My van spun out and hit an interstate pole. The impact hit where my daughter was sitting.</p>

<p>Azlynn didn't survive.</p>

<p>I'm not going to dwell here, because I didn't write this post to make you feel something. I wrote it because everything that came after — the divorce, the wandering, the rebuilding, the nine companies, the AI agents, all of it — traces back to this moment. Not as a motivational arc. As a fact.</p>

<p>That loss changed everything. It's the kind of thing that either breaks you or rebuilds you into something different. For me, it was both.</p>

<div class="post-divider"></div>

<h2 class="post-h2">The Wilderness</h2>

<p>An unexpected divorce in 2015 forced me out of the nonprofit world and into single parenthood. I moved to Texas in 2016 with my two kids, Maddi and Luci, who were five and two.</p>

<p>For three years, nothing worked.</p>

<p>I cleaned pools. I tried real estate. I flipped a house. I sold insurance. I searched for anything that would provide stability for my kids while I figured out what I was supposed to be doing now that everything I'd built before was gone.</p>

<p>I was stuck. Not in a dramatic, cinematic way — in the quiet, grinding way where every month you're trying something new and every month it doesn't quite work, and your kids need dinner and stability and you're providing dinner but not the stability.</p>

<p>Looking back, I can see what was happening. I was a builder without anything to build. The skills that made me effective as a nonprofit founder — creating organizations from nothing, convincing people to join a mission, training teams, executing across complex environments — those skills didn't disappear. They just didn't have anywhere to go yet.</p>

<div class="post-divider"></div>

<h2 class="post-h2">The Turning Point</h2>

<p>In 2019, through my network, I met Brad. He was the founder of a marketing agency in Keller, Texas. Brad didn't just give me a job — he taught me a craft. How to find clients. How to build campaigns. How to use marketing tools and software. How to prospect, pitch, and close.</p>

<p>More importantly, Brad showed me what it looked like to build a business using the exact skills I already had — relationship building, strategy, communication, execution. The packaging was different. The work felt familiar.</p>

<p>I didn't know it yet, but I'd found LinkedIn.</p>

<p>Not LinkedIn the social network. LinkedIn the business development engine. I started testing outbound strategies, connecting with decision-makers, running content experiments. The response was immediate and disproportionate. In a world where most people treated LinkedIn as a digital résumé, actually using it as a revenue channel felt like finding a cheat code.</p>

<p>I launched Stormbreaker Digital in January 2020. Within months, I was landing clients I had no business landing — professional sports franchises, SaaS companies, financial services firms. The agency hit multi-six-figure annual revenue and stayed there.</p>

<p>The Pipeline Principle — the philosophy that would later become central to my book with Tony Jeary — came directly from this experience. Your pipeline is your lifeline. The network I'd built didn't just generate revenue. It rebuilt my life. The same skills that helped me lead a nonprofit across three countries helped me build a marketing agency in Texas.</p>

<p>Everything transfers. You just can't always see it when you're in the middle.</p>

<div class="post-divider"></div>

<h2 class="post-h2">The LinkedIn Chapter</h2>

<p>From 2020 to 2023, LinkedIn was my world.</p>

<p>I built a following of over 70,000. I developed a methodology I called the BCT Method — Brand, Content, Traffic — that became the diagnostic framework for every client engagement at Stormbreaker. I co-authored "The LinkedIn Advantage" with Tony Jeary, who'd coached Fortune 500 CEOs and recognized something in how I approached business development. Tony told me once, early on: "You have a knack and gift to help people build pipeline." That phrase stuck.</p>

<p>I generated over $3 million in revenue through LinkedIn strategies — for myself and my clients. I worked with organizations across professional sports, B2B SaaS, financial services, manufacturing, and healthcare. I ran campaigns, built teams, developed frameworks, and figured out what worked by doing it thousands of times.</p>

<p>It was the first time since the nonprofit years that I felt like I was building something that matched the scale of what I was capable of. Not because the revenue was impressive — because the work was finally using all of me again.</p>

<p>But I kept building. Always the next thing.</p>

<div class="post-divider"></div>

<h2 class="post-h2">The AI Pivot</h2>

<p>When AI agent systems became viable, something clicked that I can only describe as recognition. I'd felt it before — with LinkedIn in 2019. A technology that was dramatically undervalued because most people were thinking about it wrong.</p>

<p>LinkedIn wasn't a social network. It was a revenue channel. Most people missed it because they were stuck on the "social network" framing.</p>

<p>AI agents weren't chatbots. They were autonomous workers. Most people missed it because they were stuck on the "chatbot" framing.</p>

<p>I started deploying AI agent systems for Stormbreaker's clients. Not as an add-on — as the core offering. Multi-agent teams that handled content creation, outbound sequences, lead qualification, SEO, competitive intelligence, performance monitoring. Running on schedules, producing output, operating 24/7.</p>

<p>Then I started building products. TextEvidence, because I saw an attorney drowning in text message screenshots. Skill Refinery, because Tony Jeary had a book's worth of coaching methodology that couldn't scale through one-on-one delivery. CigarSnap, because the Isenberg Framework said it would work. HeyBaddie, because my kids needed something that didn't exist. MyPRQ, because Al Gage had spent decades managing speaker queues by hand. The Cat Behavior Lab, because I wanted to prove the model works in any niche.</p>

<p>Each one built faster than the last. The AI agent infrastructure compounds — frameworks transfer, skills transfer, mistakes transfer. What used to take months takes weeks. What used to take weeks takes days.</p>

<div class="post-divider"></div>

<h2 class="post-h2">What Connects All of It</h2>

<p>People ask how a nonprofit founder ends up building AI agent systems. The question assumes these are different things.</p>

<p>They're not.</p>

<p>Building Rooftop Missions required creating an organization from nothing, recruiting people to a mission they couldn't see yet, training teams across language and cultural barriers, and executing complex programs with no budget in countries where nothing worked the way you expected.</p>

<p>Building AI agent systems requires creating organizations of agents from nothing, defining missions they'll execute autonomously, training them with skill files and reference documents, and executing complex workflows where things break in ways you don't expect.</p>

<p>The medium changed. The work didn't.</p>

<p>I build things. I've always built things. The tools got better — from organizational charts to LinkedIn campaigns to AI agent architectures — but the instinct is the same. Find a problem. Design a solution. Build the team to execute it. Ship it.</p>

<p>I didn't build my way out of that season alone. But building was — and is — the through-line. The ability to create is the most human thing we have, and I believe it's not random. The skills I have were given to me, and I have a responsibility to use them.</p>

<p>That's why I named my daughter's children's home. That's why I build products my kids need. That's why I'm up at 2am deploying AI agents for a cat behavior guide and a legal tech platform in the same week. It all comes from the same place.</p>

<div class="post-divider"></div>

<h2 class="post-h2">Where It Stands Now</h2>

<p>Today I live in Texas with my wife Nadia and my kids Maddison and Lucia. I run nine companies. I serve as fractional CMO for B2B companies across manufacturing, healthcare, and defense. I build AI agent systems that handle entire business functions autonomously.</p>

<p>The mantra that carried me from the worst moment of my life to where I am today is two words: Keep Building.</p>

<p>It's not a productivity slogan. It's not a motivational poster. It's what I actually did when everything fell apart, and it's what I'm still doing now that things are working.</p>

<p>There's a reason I keep coming back to the word "build." It's what I believe I was put here to do.</p>
