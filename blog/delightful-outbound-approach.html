    <h1 class="post-title">The Delightful Outbound Approach: Why You Don't Pitch Until Touch 3</h1>
    <p class="post-subtitle">Seven years of outbound compressed into one framework. Five touches, 23 days, and a core principle: earn the right to pitch before you open your mouth about your product.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="post-body">
  <div class="container-narrow">
    <p>I sent a family law attorney a LinkedIn message that opened with a joke about someone's aunt printing screenshots at Staples. She replied in four minutes.</p>

<p>That message didn't mention my product. Didn't mention my company. Didn't ask for a meeting. It described a scenario so specific to her daily reality that she couldn't not respond.</p>

<p>This is the Delightful Outbound approach — the framework I use across every venture — and the core principle is simple: you don't pitch until Touch 3. Maybe later. The first two touches exist to earn the right.</p>

<h2 class="post-h2">Why Most Outbound Fails</h2>

<p>Open your LinkedIn inbox right now. I'll wait.</p>

<p>You'll find some variation of this: "Hi [First Name], I've been really impressed by your work in [industry]. I noticed your impressive background and thought there might be synergy between our organizations. Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call?"</p>

<p>Delete. Everyone deletes that. The person who wrote it knows it. The person who received it definitely knows it. And yet the outbound industry keeps sending it because the math technically works — spray enough messages and someone will reply.</p>

<p>I don't want to build a business on spray-and-pray. I want replies from people who actually want to talk.</p>

<p>The problem with traditional outbound is structural. It leads with the sender — "Here's what I do, here's what I built, here's why you need it." But the recipient doesn't care about you yet. They care about their own problems. Their own deadlines. The client who just sent 400 screenshots in a Google Drive folder.</p>

<p>If your first message is about you, it's already over.</p>

<h2 class="post-h2">The Three Laws</h2>

<p>Every sequence I write follows three laws:</p>

<p><strong>Law 1: Earn the right to pitch.</strong> Cold outreach never pitches. It starts a conversation. The pitch comes after they engage. If they haven't replied, you haven't earned it.</p>

<p><strong>Law 2: Make them feel seen, not targeted.</strong> Reference their specific world — not with creepy personalization tokens, but with observations that prove you understand their daily reality. There's a difference between "I noticed your company does X" and describing the exact scenario they dealt with last Tuesday.</p>

<p><strong>Law 3: Be the message they don't delete.</strong> In a sea of "I'd love to pick your brain" and "I noticed your impressive background," be the one that makes them exhale through their nose and think, "Okay, this person gets it."</p>

<h2 class="post-h2">The 5-Touch, 23-Day Sequence</h2>

<p>Here's the full architecture. Five touches across LinkedIn and email, spread over 23 days. Each touch has a distinct purpose. They are not five versions of the same pitch.</p>

<h3 class="post-h3">Touch 1: The Connection Request</h3>

<p><strong>Channel:</strong> LinkedIn <strong>Purpose:</strong> Get accepted. That's it. <strong>Timing:</strong> Day 1</p>

<p>The connection request is roughly 300 characters. You state what space you're in, include one small human detail that signals you're a real person, and make zero ask.</p>

<p>No flattery. No "I'd love to connect and learn from you." No "I think we could help each other." Just a clear signal of who you are and why you're in their orbit.</p>

<p>The goal is a 30 to 40% acceptance rate. If you're getting less than that, your profile isn't optimized or your targeting is off. If you're getting more than that, you're probably being too vague about who you are.</p>

<h3 class="post-h3">Touch 2: The Value Touch</h3>

<p><strong>Channel:</strong> LinkedIn DM <strong>Purpose:</strong> Get a reply by asking a genuine question they enjoy answering. <strong>Timing:</strong> 1 day after acceptance</p>

<p>This is where the magic happens — and where most people blow it.</p>

<p>Touch 2 opens with a question that triggers a memory or emotion. It includes one or two specific, funny scenarios that prove you understand their world. It ends with an easy, low-commitment ask — their opinion, their experience, their version of the story.</p>

<p>The humor formula is specificity. "Clients send messy files" isn't funny. "Someone's aunt printing screenshots at Staples" is funny because it's specific enough to be a real story, and everyone in that profession has their own version of it.</p>

<p>Good humor sources: things clients do that are well-intentioned but chaotic, the gap between how something "should" work and how it actually works, universal profession-specific experiences that never get talked about publicly.</p>

<p>What you never mention in Touch 2: your product. Your features. Your pricing. A call. A meeting. Nothing. This touch exists to start a real conversation.</p>

<h3 class="post-h3">Touch 3: The Soft Qualify</h3>

<p><strong>Channel:</strong> Email <strong>Purpose:</strong> Reach them on a different channel with a fresh angle. First time the product gets mentioned — casually. <strong>Timing:</strong> 3 days after the DM</p>

<p>By Touch 3, you've moved to email — a different channel with a different feel. The subject line should be specific and slightly weird, referencing a concrete scenario rather than a value proposition. Something like "The 400-screenshot Google Drive folder."</p>

<p>In the body, you expand on the shared reality with more relatable scenarios. You casually mention what you're building — one line, not a features list. You emphasize that hearing their stories and experience is genuinely valuable.</p>

<p>The key word is "casually." You don't pitch. You mention. "I actually built something that handles exactly this" is not a pitch. It's a breadcrumb. If they're curious, they'll pull the thread.</p>

<p>Keep it under 150 words. No feature lists. No demo links. No "I'd love to schedule a call." You're still earning.</p>

<h3 class="post-h3">Touch 4: The Ask</h3>

<p><strong>Channel:</strong> LinkedIn DM <strong>Purpose:</strong> Lightweight reminder that opens the door. <strong>Timing:</strong> 5 days after the email</p>

<p>Touch 4 is two or three lines maximum. You reference the running theme from previous touches, simply restate the ask, and casually offer to share what you're building.</p>

<p>"If you're curious what I'm building, happy to share" is the operative phrase. It's an open door, not a push.</p>

<h3 class="post-h3">Touch 5: The Nurture</h3>

<p><strong>Channel:</strong> Email <strong>Purpose:</strong> Graceful exit that often generates the highest reply rate. <strong>Timing:</strong> 7 days after the nudge</p>

<p>The breakup message. Counterintuitively, this is frequently the touch that gets the reply.</p>

<p>You acknowledge their time is valuable — they have real work to do. You paint one specific moment where they'd think of your product. A visceral, recognizable scenario. You drop your URL once, casually. You wish them well.</p>

<p>This is not a last-ditch pitch. It's a graceful bow. People respond when they feel the window closing. A respectful exit without guilt or pressure triggers the reply that four previous touches couldn't.</p>

<h2 class="post-h2">Why It Works: The Psychology</h2>

<p>The Delightful Outbound approach works because it reverses the power dynamic.</p>

<p>Traditional outbound positions the sender as the one who needs something — a meeting, a demo, a sale. That puts the recipient in the power position, and their easiest move is to ignore you.</p>

<p>This approach positions the sender as someone who understands the recipient's world and is genuinely curious about their experience. The recipient isn't being asked to give something up. They're being invited to share something they know. That's a fundamentally different proposition.</p>

<p>People love talking about their work to someone who actually gets it. That's the unlock.</p>

<h2 class="post-h2">Running It at Scale Without Losing the Human Feel</h2>

<p>The question I always get: "This sounds great for 10 people. How do you do it for 400?"</p>

<p>The answer is AI agents executing human-crafted sequences.</p>

<p>I use HeyReach for server-side LinkedIn automation — connection requests, profile views, DMs — running 24/7 without needing a browser open. SmartLead handles email with warmed inboxes and inbox rotation. Clay provides the enrichment layer that powers personalization at the contact level.</p>

<p>But here's what's critical: the AI executes the sequence, it doesn't write the sequence. The empathy research, the humor, the scenario-specific copy — that's human work. I spend significant time understanding the audience before writing a single word.</p>

<p>The empathy exercise asks questions most outbound teams never consider: What does their Tuesday at 2pm look like? What's the recurring frustration they complain about to colleagues but never post about? What inside joke would they laugh at that outsiders wouldn't get?</p>

<p>Once that work is done, the sequence gets loaded into the automation tools and runs. The AI handles timing, channel switching, and reply detection. An AI SDR — like Claudia, the one I built for TextEvidence — handles reply management with defined boundaries and escalation rules.</p>

<p>The human decides what to say. The AI decides when and how to deliver it. That's the split that preserves the feel while enabling scale.</p>

<h2 class="post-h2">The Earn-the-Right Philosophy</h2>

<p>I keep coming back to this phrase: earn the right.</p>

<p>Earn the right to pitch. Earn the right to ask for a meeting. Earn the right to show what you built.</p>

<p>Most outbound assumes the right. It assumes that because you found someone's email, you've earned the right to describe your product to them. You haven't. You've earned the right to say hello.</p>

<p>When you treat outreach as a conversation that has to be earned rather than a pipeline that has to be filled, something shifts. Reply rates go up. But more importantly, the quality of the conversations goes up. The people who reply are people who actually want to talk. And those are the conversations that turn into something real.</p>

<p>I've built this framework across legal tech, industrial manufacturing, workforce development, defense contracting, and healthcare. Different audiences, different inside jokes, different Tuesday-at-2pm scenarios. Same structure. Same philosophy.</p>

<p>Earn the right. Then pitch.</p>
